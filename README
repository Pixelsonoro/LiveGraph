LiveGraph for jQuery
====================

LiveGraph is a jQuery Plugin that allows the creation of simple bar charts from a simple JavaScript Object or an HTML table. LiveGraph allows updating of the values used to create the bar chart - by dynamically adjusting the height of the bars and rescaling the graph. Charts created with LiveGraph can easily be linked to a website's backend using AJAX to allow a graph to automatically update to display a set of data.

LiveGraphs can be customized to suit different uses, bars can be styled using CSS to change background colours / patterns and labels can have different font styles / sizes.
